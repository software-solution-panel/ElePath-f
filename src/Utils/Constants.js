/**
   *    Elepath Front-end follows semantic versioning (semver - https://semver.org/) principles.
   *    That means that with a version number x.y.z:
   *
   *    - Critical bug fixes by changing the z number (ex: 15.6.2 to 15.6.3).
   *    - New features or non-critical fixes, by changing the y number (ex: 15.6.2 to 15.7.0).
   *    - Breaking changes by changing the x number (ex: 15.6.2 to 16.0.0).
   *    - Major releases can also contain new features, and any release can include bug fixes.
   *
   *    Minor releases are the most common type of release.
